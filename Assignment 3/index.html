            <br>
            <h2> What do I enjoy?</h2>
            <p>I have many things that I really enjoy doing. I really enjoy swimming and working out to stay healthy.</p>
            <p>I really enjoy doing outdoor activities. Those really hype me up . Go hiking, go biking to San Diego, hanging out with my girlfrind and friends makes me feel happy.</p>
            <p> On the other hand, staying home all day, really lowers my energy a lot </p>
